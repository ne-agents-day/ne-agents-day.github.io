        <h2>About The Workshop</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous AI agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling
          systems to perceive, reason, and act within complex environments with minimal human intervention.
          Powered by advances in LLMs, reinforcement learning, and orchestration frameworks, agents are able
          to efficiently integrate planning, memory, and tool use in a compute-intensive paradigm to perform
          multi-step tasks in domains such as software development, healthcare, and education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite recent progress, achieving reliable agent performance in real-world systems remains a
          comprehensive problem, and coordination across the full stack (ML, systems, and HCI) is underexplored.
          Progress will require work across:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Better model training recipes and agent frameworks;</li>
          <li>Better system abstractions for both agents and their environments, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, reliability, and observability;</li>
          <li>Better personalization and human interpretability for seamless human-agent interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal of this workshop is to offer a comprehensive overview of AI agents, bring these research
          communities together to share progress, discuss common problems and evaluation setups, and identify
          opportunities for collaboration. We aim to bring together attendees from diverse disciplines to foster
          interdisciplinary collaboration and discuss open research questions.

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>
          We welcome contributions to a broad range of topics on the design, development, systems support,
          and applications of AI Agents, including but not limited to:
        </p>

        <div class="topics">
          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Interfaces and Embodiment</h3>
            <p>
              How should agents perceive and act within their environments (e.g., through tool use, exploration,
              or interactions)? Should we design unified systems or specialized agents for different modalities?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Training Recipes and Data for Agentic Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              How can we improve agentic capabilities with more effective training algorithms and better data
              mixtures? What evaluation-driven training practices best translate into reliable performance on
              real-world, multi-step tasks?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Safety and Societal Implications</h3>
            <p>
              What guardrails are necessary to ensure AI agents operate safely in real-world settings? How can
              we address the ethical, economic, and societal challenges posed by autonomous agents?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Human-Agent Interaction, Alignment, and Personalization</h3>
            <p>
              How can we personalize AI agents to adapt their behavior to dynamic user preferences across
              individuals, groups, and contexts? How will future interactions between humans and AI agents evolve?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>
              What are some exciting areas of application for agents? How can we push the frontiers of agentic
              applications in areas such as computer use, data science, applications for science (e.g., scientific
              discovery and deep research), education, healthcare, and software development?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Benchmarking and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
              How can we develop robust environments and evaluation metrics that capture the diversity of
              real-world settings?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Scalable Architectures for Training and Running Agents</h3>
            <p>
              What runtime and infrastructure abstractions are needed to train, evaluate, and deploy agents
              reliably at scale under strict latency, cost, data, and quality requirements?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Context, State, and Orchestration of Agentic Systems</h3>
            <p>
              How should agent context and state be represented, managed, and shared over time? What abstractions
              enable agents to coordinate through shared data, memory, or environments while remaining easily
              programmable? How do we effectively orchestrate and control multi-agent systems for complex tasks?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="topic">
            <h3>Governance, Observability, Debugging, and Reproducibility of Agents</h3>
            <p>
              How can we build tracing, provenance, replay, and root-cause analysis tools that make agent behavior
              inspectable and reproducible—especially under non-determinism and tool/environment drift?
            </p>
